### Problem-Solving-Notes

## Overview
Understanding and manipulating algorithms is an essential skill for every Cybersecurity Engineer. This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey of mastering problem-solving skills, focusing on insights and notes from two influential books:

    DSA (Data Structure and Algorithms) by Granville Barnett and Luca Del Tongo
    Think Like a Programmer by V. Anton Spraul

## Purpose
The aim of this repository is to enhance my problem-solving abilities during the summer alongside my studies in Cybersecurity. By summarizing and extracting key concepts from these books, I hope to create a valuable resource that can benefit others interested in strengthening their algorithmic thinking and programming skills.

## How to Use This Repository
Feel free to explore the notes and summaries provided in this repository. Each section is organized by book and chapter, making it easy to find specific topics. Use these notes as a supplement to your own studies or as a quick reference guide.
